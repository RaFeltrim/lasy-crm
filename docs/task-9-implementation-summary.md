## Technical Details

### API Endpoints

#### POST /api/leads/import
- **Purpose**: Import leads from CSV or XLSX file

### Data Flow

**Import Flow:**

## Testing Recommendations

1. **Import Testing:**
   - Test with sample CSV file (provided in docs/)
   - Test with XLSX file
   - Test with invalid file types
   - Test with files exceeding 1000 rows
   - Test with validation errors (invalid email, missing name, etc.)
   - Test with empty files
   - Test with malformed CSV/XLSX

2. **Export Testing:**
   - Test CSV export with various lead counts (0, 1, many)
   - Test XLSX export with various lead counts
   - Verify exported data matches database
   - Test with special characters in lead data
   - Verify file downloads correctly

3. **Integration Testing:**
   - Import leads and verify they appear in Kanban board
   - Import leads and verify they appear in leads list
   - Export leads and re-import to verify data integrity
   - Test concurrent imports
   - Test import/export with real-time updates

## Known Limitations

1. Maximum 1000 rows per import (by design)
2. No support for importing interactions (leads only)
3. No support for updating existing leads via import (creates new leads only)
4. No progress tracking for export (instant for reasonable data sizes)
5. No support for custom field mapping

## Future Enhancements

1. Support for importing interactions
2. Update existing leads option (match by email)
3. Custom field mapping interface
4. Import templates with pre-filled data
5. Scheduled exports
6. Export filters (date range, status, etc.)
7. Import history tracking
8. Duplicate detection and merging
9. Batch import with multiple files
10. Import preview before committing
