   - API endpoints require authentication

4. **Session Management Tests:**
   - Valid credentials create a session
   - Session contains valid user data
   - Session tokens are valid
   - Invalid credentials are rejected

**Documentation:**

## Security Features Summary

### Defense in Depth

The implementation follows a defense-in-depth strategy with multiple layers:

1. **Network Layer**: HTTPS enforcement, security headers
2. **Application Layer**: Authentication, rate limiting, CORS
3. **Input Layer**: Validation (Zod), sanitization
4. **Data Layer**: RLS policies, parameterized queries
5. **Output Layer**: React's automatic HTML escaping

### Key Security Measures

✅ **Authentication**: Required for all protected routes and API endpoints
✅ **Authorization**: RLS policies enforce data access at database level
✅ **Input Validation**: Zod schemas validate all inputs
✅ **Input Sanitization**: Custom sanitization prevents XSS
✅ **SQL Injection Prevention**: Parameterized queries via Supabase
✅ **XSS Prevention**: Sanitization + React escaping + CSP
✅ **CSRF Protection**: SameSite cookies (handled by Supabase)
✅ **Rate Limiting**: Prevents abuse and DoS attacks
✅ **HTTPS Enforcement**: Encrypted communication in production
✅ **Security Headers**: Multiple headers for defense in depth
✅ **CORS**: Controlled cross-origin access
✅ **Session Management**: Secure token handling via Supabase

## Testing and Verification

### Automated Testing

Run the security verification script:

```bash
export TEST_USER_EMAIL="test@example.com"
export TEST_USER_PASSWORD="your-password"
npx tsx scripts/verify-security.ts
```

### Manual Testing Checklist

- [ ] Test unauthenticated access to protected routes
- [ ] Test API endpoints without authentication token
- [ ] Test rate limiting by making rapid requests
- [ ] Test input sanitization with XSS payloads
- [ ] Test RLS by attempting to access other users' data
- [ ] Verify security headers in browser dev tools
- [ ] Test HTTPS redirect in production
- [ ] Test CORS with different origins

## Production Deployment Checklist

- [ ] Set `NODE_ENV=production`
- [ ] Configure `ALLOWED_ORIGINS` environment variable
- [ ] Ensure HTTPS is enabled
- [ ] Verify SSL/TLS certificate is valid
- [ ] Test security headers in production
- [ ] Run security verification script
- [ ] Monitor rate limit violations
- [ ] Set up error tracking (e.g., Sentry)
- [ ] Configure log aggregation
- [ ] Review and test incident response procedures

## Performance Considerations

### Rate Limiting

The current in-memory rate limiting is suitable for single-server deployments. For production with multiple servers:

**Recommended Solutions:**
- Redis for distributed rate limiting
- Cloudflare or similar CDN with built-in rate limiting
- API Gateway with rate limiting capabilities

### Sanitization

Input sanitization adds minimal overhead:
- String operations are fast
- Applied only to user inputs (not on every request)
- Cached results benefit from React Query

## Security Monitoring

### Metrics to Monitor

1. **Rate Limit Violations**: Track 429 responses
2. **Authentication Failures**: Track 401 responses
3. **Validation Errors**: Track 400 responses
4. **Database Errors**: Track 500 responses
5. **Unusual Access Patterns**: Multiple failed login attempts

### Logging

All security-relevant events are logged:
- Authentication attempts (success/failure)
- Rate limit violations
- Validation errors
- Database errors
- API errors with context

## Compliance

The implementation addresses common security standards:

- **OWASP Top 10**: Addresses injection, XSS, broken authentication, etc.
- **GDPR**: Data access controls via RLS
- **SOC 2**: Security controls and monitoring
- **PCI DSS**: Secure data handling (if applicable)

## Known Limitations

1. **Rate Limiting**: In-memory storage not suitable for multi-server production
2. **CSP**: Uses 'unsafe-inline' for styles (required by Tailwind)
3. **Session Storage**: Relies on Supabase's session management

## Future Enhancements

1. Implement distributed rate limiting with Redis
2. Add request signing for API calls
3. Implement API key authentication for service-to-service calls
4. Add security event webhooks
5. Implement automated security scanning in CI/CD
6. Add honeypot fields for bot detection
7. Implement device fingerprinting
8. Add geolocation-based access controls
