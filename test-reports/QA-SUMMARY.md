   - Runs unit tests
   - Runs linting
   - Runs type checking
   - Runs production build
   - Generates JSON and Markdown reports

2. **scripts/security-audit.ts** - Security validation
   - Checks authentication security
   - Validates RLS policies
   - Verifies API endpoint security
   - Checks input sanitization
   - Validates security headers
   - Checks environment configuration
   - Generates detailed security report

3. **scripts/performance-validation.ts** - Performance checks
   - Validates build size
   - Checks Lighthouse configuration
   - Verifies code splitting
   - Checks image optimization
   - Validates caching strategy
   - Generates performance report

### Running the Scripts

```bash
# Run comprehensive QA suite
npx tsx scripts/qa-test-suite.ts

# Run security audit
npx tsx scripts/security-audit.ts

# Run performance validation
npx tsx scripts/performance-validation.ts
```

## Known Issues

### TypeScript Strict Mode Warnings (Non-Blocking)

**Status:** ⚠️ LOW PRIORITY  
**Impact:** None on runtime - all tests pass

TypeScript strict mode shows some type inference warnings with Supabase types. These are cosmetic and don't affect functionality.

**Affected:** 6 files (API routes, components, utilities)  
**Action:** Can be resolved post-launch with type assertions or updated Supabase types

### Minor Recommendations

1. Run `npm audit` to check for dependency vulnerabilities
2. Consider adding RLS policy migration files to a standard location
3. Set up production monitoring and error tracking
4. Address TypeScript warnings in future iteration
