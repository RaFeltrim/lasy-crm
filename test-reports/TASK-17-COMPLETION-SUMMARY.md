## Known Issues

### TypeScript Strict Mode Warnings

**Severity:** LOW (Non-Blocking)  
**Impact:** None on runtime functionality

TypeScript strict mode shows type inference warnings with Supabase database types. These are cosmetic issues that don't affect functionality.

**Affected Files:**
- `app/api/leads/route.ts`
- `app/api/leads/import/route.ts`
- `components/SearchResults.tsx`
- `lib/security-verification.ts`
- `lib/validations/interaction.ts`
- `scripts/security-audit.ts`

**Resolution:** Can be addressed post-launch with explicit type assertions or updated Supabase type generation. Does not block production deployment.

---

## Recommendations

### Immediate Actions (Pre-Launch)
1. Run `npm audit` to check for dependency vulnerabilities
2. Review and address any critical security findings
3. Set up production monitoring and error tracking
4. Configure production environment variables

### Post-Launch Actions
1. Monitor Core Web Vitals in production
2. Track error rates and API performance
3. Collect user feedback
4. Address TypeScript warnings in next iteration

### Future Enhancements
1. Add visual regression testing
2. Implement comprehensive logging
3. Add performance budgets to CI/CD
4. Consider A/B testing framework
