### 7.3 Known Issues

#### TypeScript Strict Mode Warnings

**Status:** ⚠️ NON-BLOCKING  
**Severity:** Low  
**Impact:** None on runtime functionality

There are TypeScript strict mode warnings related to Supabase database type inference. These do not affect runtime functionality as all unit tests pass and the application works correctly.

**Affected Files:**
- `app/api/leads/route.ts` - Insert type inference
- `app/api/leads/import/route.ts` - Bulk insert type inference  
- `components/SearchResults.tsx` - Optional highlighted properties
- `lib/security-verification.ts` - Test utility type inference
- `lib/validations/interaction.ts` - Enum definition
- `scripts/security-audit.ts` - Set iteration

**Recommendation:** Update Supabase type generation or add explicit type assertions. This can be addressed in a future iteration without impacting production deployment.

**Minor Recommendations:**
1. Run `npm audit` to check for dependency vulnerabilities
2. Consider adding RLS policy migration files to version control
3. Monitor real-world performance metrics post-launch
